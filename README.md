<h1 align="center">☕Welcome To Coffee Shop!☕</h1>

Coffee Shop is a project designed and developed a dynamic and modern coffee shop website using cutting-edge technologies to showcase my versatility and commitment to continuous learning. Leveraging Next.js for its robust React framework and server-side rendering capabilities, I incorporated TypeScript to enhance code maintainability and catch potential errors early in the development process. The user interface is styled with the highly efficient Tailwind CSS, ensuring a sleek and responsive design. Additionally, I integrated Supabase as the backend, harnessing its seamless database capabilities for efficient data management. This project not only demonstrates my proficiency in the specified tech stack but also showcases my ability to create a fully functional and aesthetically pleasing web application for a real-world scenario. Currently I am working on Version 2.0 will include features such as a working cart, a robust login and sign-up system along with security features such as encrypting keys using salts.
